        <p>A hotel is an establishment that provides paid lodging on a short-term basis.
          Facilities provided may range from a modest-quality mattress in a small room to
          large suites with bigger, higher-quality beds, a dresser, a refrigerator and
          other kitchen facilities, upholstered chairs, a flat screen television, and
          en-suite bathrooms. Small, lower-priced hotels may offer only the most basic
          guest services and facilities. Larger, higher-priced hotels may provide
          additional guest facilities such as a swimming pool, business centre
          (with computers, printers, and other office equipment), childcare,
          conference and event facilities, tennis or basketball courts, gymnasium,
          restaurants, day spa, and social function services. Hotel rooms are usually
          numbered (or named in some smaller hotels and B&Bs) to allow guests to
          identify their room.</p>
